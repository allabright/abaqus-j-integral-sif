	abstract = {A strategy is developed to model crack initiation and propagation within Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)-based simulation of solids under impact. While discretizing the continuum, an efﬁcient immediate neighbor interaction is formulated by using suitable spring-like connectivity among discrete particles. Degradation of the spring forces between particles is determined through a material damage evolution law. In order to modify the level of interaction between particles, an interaction coefﬁcient is introduced in the conservation equations. This interaction coefﬁcient is determined based on the accumulated damage in the connecting springs. A fully damaged spring is considered as the initiation of crack between connected particles. The propagation of the crack path is captured through the sequence of such damaged springs. However, the neighbors connected by those damaged springs will interact in case of crack closure, transferring compression as in the case between two free surfaces. The superior performance of the proposed strategy is demonstrated via few examples.},

	abstract = {In this work, an extended finite element method with partial Heaviside function enrichment (XFEM-P) in the crack tip element is proposed for fracture analysis for the first time. In this method, the crack tip element is divided into cracked and uncracked domains naturally by the crack geometry. In the cracked domain, Heaviside function enrichment is employed to simulate the crack discontinuity across the crack surface. In the uncracked domain, the displacement from standard finite element method is employed. Ramp function is used to ensure the displacement continuity in the method. Through this way, the crack tip can be arbitrarily located inside the crack tip element, which is a great advantage over traditional counterpart, i.e., XFEM with only Heaviside function enrichment (XFEM-H). Thus the mesh work for the XFEM-P is much easier than that of the XFEM-H, resulting in great conveniences for crack propagation. The new method is applied to several examples. From the computed results, it is observed that the XFEM-P offers more accurate results than the XFEM-H in terms of strain energy and SIFs. The XFEM-P performs better than XFEM-H in numerical properties such as convergence rate and condition number.},

	abstract = {A novel domain integral approach is introduced for the accurate computation of pointwise J-integral and stress intensity factors (SIFs) of 3D planar cracks using tetrahedral elements. This method is efﬁcient and easy to implement, and does not require a structured mesh around the crack front. The method relies on the construction of virtual disk-shaped integral domains at points along the crack front, and the computation of domain integrals using a series of virtual triangular and line elements. The accuracy of the numerical results computed for through-the-thickness, penny-shaped, and elliptical crack conﬁgurations has been validated by using the available analytical formulations. The average error of computed SIFs remains below 1\% for ﬁne meshes, and 2–3\% for coarse ones. The results of an extensive parametric study suggest that there exists an optimum mesh-dependent domain radius at which the computed SIFs are the most accurate. Furthermore, the results provide evidence that tetrahedral elements are efﬁcient, reliable and robust instruments for accurate linear elastic fracture mechanics calculations.},

However, when it comes to ductile fracture, an uniﬁed approach is quite beneﬁcial for an accurate modelling of this phenomenon. Ductile materials may undergo moderate to large plastic deformations and internal degradation phenomena which are well described by continuum theories. Nevertheless in the ﬁnal stages of failure, a discontinuous methodology is essential to represent surface decohesion and macro-crack propagation. In this work, XFEM is combined with the Lemaitre ductile damage model in a way that crack initiation and propagation are governed by the evolution of damage. The model was built under a ﬁnite strain assumption and a non-local integral formulation is applied to avoid pathological mesh dependence. The efﬁciency of the proposed methodology is evaluated through various numerical examples.},

	abstract = {An equivalent domain integral (EDI) method for calculating J-integrals for twodimensional cracked elastic bodies is presented. The details of the method and its implementation are presented for isoparametric elements. The total and product integrals consist of the sum of an area or domain integral and line integrals on the crack faces. The line integrals vanish only when the crack faces are traction free and the loading is either pure mode I or pure mode II or a combination of both with only the square-root singular term in the stress field. The ED1 method gave accurate values of the J-integrals for two mode I and two mixed mode problems. Numerical studies showed that domains consisting of one layer of elements are sufficient to obtain accurate J-integral values. Two procedures for separating the individual modes from the domain integrals are presented. The procedure that uses the symmetric and antisymmetric components of the stress and displacement fields to calculate the individual modes gave accurate values of the integrals for all problems analysed. The ED1 method when applied to a problem of an interface crack in two different materials showed that the mode I and mode II components are domain dependent while the total integral is not. This behavior is caused by the presence of the oscillatory part of the singularity in bimaterial crack problems. The ED1 method, thus, shows behavior similar to the virtual crack closure method for bimaterial problems.},

	abstract = {Mode I fracture mechanics has been relatively mature but mixed mode fracture mechanics continues to present challenges, in particular for ductile materials under multiaxial stresses. Since most engineering materials, e.g., metals, exhibit elasto-plastic or ductile behaviour and are subjected to inclined cracks and/or multiaxial loading, there is a well justified need to establish a solid understanding of their fracture behaviour under mixed modes. The intention of this paper is to critically review mixed mode fracture criteria for predicting the crack propagation in metals. Experimental methods for determining the fracture toughness under different mode mixities are reviewed and discussed. More importantly, research gaps in current studies are identified and further research needs are proposed. Through this review, it is found that the mixed mode fracture criteria need to be based on elasto-plastic fracture mechanics to account for large plastic deformation, and that for ductile metals, the addition of Mode II or Mode III loading can lead to a remarkable decrease of total fracture toughness of the metal, whilst the total fracture toughness of less ductile metals is insensitive to the addition of Mode II or Mode III loading. This review can contribute to the development of advanced mixed mode fracture criteria and testing methods for ductile metals.},

Résumé
On établit l'utilité de la méthode de l'élément fini pour les calculs des facteurs d'intensité de la tension de rupture en bout. Bien qu'habituellement les méthodes d'éléments finis ne peuvent pas représenter la singularité de la force de rupture en bout, il est possible d'obtenir par un procédé simple des valeurs significatives de ces facteurs d'intensité. Les résultats sont comparés à ceux des autres solutions analytiques, et une corrélation supplémentaire est effectuée avec types spécimens différents d'essai de rupture.
Zusammenfassung
Die Zweckmässigkeit der Methode der endlichen Elemente für die Errechnung von Spannungsfaktoren an Rissspitzen wird dargelegt. Obzwar die gewöhnlichen Methoden der endlichen Elemente nicht imstande sind die Singularität der Rissspitzenspannung vorzustellen, können mittels eines einfachen Verfahrens doch sinnvolle Werte für Spannungsfaktoren an den Rissspitzen erhalten werden. Die Ergebnisse werden nicht nur mit den Ergebnissen anderer analytischer Lösungen verglichen, sondern es wird auch eine zusätzliche Korrelation von zwei verschiedenen Typen von Bruchprobekörpern vorgenommen.},

	abstract = {A new path-independent contour integral formula is presented to estimate the crack-tip integral parameter, J -value, for two-dimensional cracked elastic bodies which may quantify the severity of the crack-tip stress ÿelds. The conventional J -integral method based on a line integral has been converted to an equivalent area or domain integral (EDI) by the divergence theorem. It is noted that the EDI method is very attractive because all the quantities necessary for computation of domain integrals are readily available in a ÿnite element analysis. The details and its implementation are extended to the p-version FE model with hierarchic elements using integrals of Legendre polynomials. By decomposing the displacement ÿeld obtained from the p-version ÿnite element analysis into symmetric and antisymmetric displacement ÿelds with respect to the crack line, the Mode-I and Mode-II non-dimensional stress intensity factors can be determined by using the decomposition method. The example problems for validating the proposed techniques are centrally oblique cracked plates under tensile loading. The numerical results associated with the variation of oblique angles show very good agreement with the existing solutions. Also, the selective distribution of polynomial orders and the corner elements for automatic mesh generation are applied to improve the numerical solution in this paper. ? 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this work, we propose an alternative formulation of the interaction integral functional and a method to compute stress intensity factors along the crack front which can be shown to converge. The novelty of our method is the decoupling of the two discretizations: the bulk mesh for the finite element solution and the mesh along the crack front for the numerical stress intensity factors, and hence we term it the multiple mesh interaction integral (MMII) method. Through analysis of the convergence of the functional and method, we find scalings of these two mesh sizes to guarantee convergence of the computed stress intensity factors in a variety of norms, including maximum pointwise error and total variation. We demonstrate the MMII on four examples: a semiinfinite straight crack with the asymptotic displacement fields, the same geometry with a nonuniform stress intensity factor along the crack front, a spherical cap crack in a cylinder under tension, and the elliptical crack under far-field tension and shear.},

The I-integral is the two-state mutual energy release rate decided by a designable auxiliary field and the actual field. Due to the designability of the auxiliary field, the I-integral has been used extensively in extracting the individual stress intensity factors (SIFs) and the T-stress of a crack in single materials or at a bi-material interface. The practical implementation of the I-integral mainly experienced three periods. 1) In the last quarter of the twentieth century, the pathindependent I-integral was developed for homogeneous materials subjected to static, dynamic and/or thermal loading. 2) In the 2000 s, the domain-form I-integrals were discussed to deal with inhomogeneous materials. 3) In the past decade, the domain-independent I-integral (DII-integral) was proposed for multi-interface materials. After that, we review the I-integrals for functional materials and the extensions of the I-integral to some new fracture problems. Subsequently, diverse practical applications are introduced. Various research works demonstrate that the I-in­ tegral is a most accurate and reliable approach to extracting the individual SIFs and T-stress for the materials obeying linear constitutive law or the materials with limited nonlinear effect. Finally, the advantages, limitations, and future issues of the I-integral method are discussed.},

	abstract = {New domain integrals for extracting mixed-mode stress intensity factors along curved, three-dimensional bimaterial interface cracks arederived. In the derivation, the asymptotic auxiliary fields for the plane problem of a bimaterial interface crack are imposed along a curved crack front. The general crack-tip interaction integral (a contour integral surrounding a point on the crack front which is evaluated in the limit as the contour is shrunk onto the crack tip) is then expressed in domain form which is more suitable for mnnerical computation. A consequence of imposing the auxiliary fields along a curved crack front is that the auxiliary stress fields do not satisfy equilibrium, and the auxiliary strain fields do not satisfy compatibility. The terms which arise due to the lack of equilibrium and compatibility are not sufficiently singular to contribute to the crack-tip interaction integral or to affect its path independence ; however, these terms become important when domain integral representations are introduced, because they involve fields which are not asymptotically close to the crack tip. In order to compute the pointwise stress intensity factors along the crack front, the domain integrals are evaluated as a post-processing step in the finite element method. In the numerical results, it is demonstrated that it is crucial to incorporate the terms that arise due to lack of equilibrium and compatibility of the auxiliary fields, especially in regions where the local crack front curvature is high. In the paper, we present two numerical examples. As a benchmark, we first consider the problem of a penny-shaped interface crack embedded in a cylinder. The results for the complex stress intensity factor and phase angle are found to be in excellent agreement with the analytical solution. The problem of an elliptical crack embedded between two dissimilar isotropic materials is also considered, and the results are discussed 0 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The stress intensity factors are determined from the singular stress ﬁeld close to the crack front. Two different fracture criteria are adopted for the calculation of an equivalent stress intensity factor and crack deﬂection angle. The stress intensity factor distributions for both numerical methods agree well to available reference solutions. Deviations are recorded at crack front locations near the free surface probably due to global contraction effects and the twisting behaviour of the crack front. Crack propagation calculations for the three point bending specimen give results that satisfy intuitive expectations.

	abstract = {Damage tolerant designs are necessary for the continuous operation of aircraft engines which are subjected to harsh environmental influences during operation (e.g. large temperatures, foreign object damage of airfoils). One important aspect of damage tolerance is crack propagation which can be investigated via 3D numerical software. This Master Thesis project focuses on investigating and implementing the submodel technique in MTU Aero Engines' own FEM (Finite Element Method) based in-house crack propagation calculation tool known as Cracktracer 3D. The key points of the project are the theoretical background behind the submodel technique, the changes that have be to made to Cracktracer 3D's Python/C/Fortran based code and the verification and validation of the method by comparing the crack propagation parameters for real engine components with the results of an already established method. It is theorized that the submodel technique will provide more accurate stress intensity factors for complex engineering applications. The need to investigate the capabilities of the submodel technique arises from MTU's desire to have a more reliable alternative to its current method. The findings could have a valuable contribution towards lowering the design safety margin of MTU Aero Engines components. Having a more stable automatic crack propagation calculation routine can also lead to more efficient engine component designs which can directly be translated to weight/cost savings. The side-by-side comparison of two different numerical routines applied on the same examples can also give some valuable insight into the advantages and disadvantages of either methods.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;The main objective of this thesis project is to reduce the number of test cases in which MTU Aero Engines' crack propagation calculation tool Cracktracer 3D fails to predict the correct crack propagation parameters by investigating the applicability of a submodel method consisting of a pure tetrahedral global model followed by a hexahedral submodel calculation.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;d to investigate the capabilities of the submodel technique arises from MTU's desire to have a more reliable alternative to its current method.

The actual initial crack shape is inserted into the structure, thereby automatically re-meshing the neighborhood of the crack in two zones. The first zone consist of a flexible cylindrical tube introduced at the crack tip. This tube contains collapsed hexahedral elements which ensures that the stress singularity at the crack tip is represented correctly. The second zone is located beyond the cylindrical tube and has a tetrahedral mesh created with NETGEN, a free 2D-3D tetrahedral meshing software. In order to determine the crack propagation size and direction, the stress intensity factor concept is applied. CalculiX is used for determining the stresses required by the postprocessor where the actually stress intensity factors are computed and the new crack front is obtained. The complex merging of the two zones together with the intersections of the resulting mesh with the crack shape and with the uncracked domain is the primary reason for the failure of the program.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;To prevent the failure of the program due to complex crack geometry, an alternative procedure is proposed. The two zones described above are replaced by a coarse mesh containing only tetrahedral elements. The stresses obtained from this purely tetrahedral mesh are not accurate enough to predict the correct stress intensity factors. In order to solve this issue, a submodel is created at the crack front. This submodel consists of a tube-like mesh with collapsed and finer hexahedral elements. The external boundary conditions of this tube are interpolated from the tetrahedral coarse grid resulting into a smaller, but also more accurate problem to obtain the stress intensity factor values at the core of the tube. Such an approach effectively removes the need to merge a hexahedral tube mesh with a tetrahedral one and can thus lead to a much more stable program. The computation time is also decreased. While the underlying principles of this technique are not new, the scope of its applicability, the comparison with another existing technique and the implementation methodology introduced in this thesis are unique.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;In order to validate such an approach, five different examples are used: a corner crack specimen under Mode I loading, a corner crack specimen under Mode III loading, a torque specimen under Mode I-III loading, a turbine vane carrier under Mode I loading together with thermal stresses and a shrouded turbine blade under mixed mode loading with thermal stresses. The most important crack parameters (e.g. maximum crack size during each increment, maximum equivalent stress intensity factor during each increment) obtained from both methods are compared for 100 crack increments. Generally, the results match very well as the crack shapes are almost identical. There is a slight disagreement occurring for some of the test cases at the free surface due to the tube submodel sticking out of the component which leads to different stress intensity factors being obtained. This difference is caused by interpolation errors. It is well known however that the stress intensity factors are not very accurate at this location even for the original method since the stress singularity changes at the free surface. A study into how fine the submodel mesh and the global tetrahedral mesh need to be is also conducted. The results indicate no significant improvement of a finer tetrahedral mesh but refining the tube submodel mesh does improve the computation of the stress intensity factors since there are more nodes present at the submodel's boundary where the displacements are interpolated. Any type of mesh refinement however comes at the cost of an increase in computation time. \&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;The submodel method is capable of computing sufficiently accurate results faster than the original combined hexahedral-tetrahedral method. Many more types of initial cracks can be inserted for the submodel method without forcing the user to increase the tube radius to account for different crack geometries and the complex merging of the meshes as in the original method. The main focus of additional research should be on testing the submodel approach on more complex case studies with multiple load steps in order to ensure that all the relevant features (e.g. concentrated loads, distributed loads, residual stresses) are correctly transferred from the coarse tetrahedral mesh to the submodel. Additionally, a possible combination of both approaches by alternating from one method to the other during the same case study, thereby utilizing each method's strengths when needed, is also worth investigating.},

The problem is reduced to the determination of mixed-mode stress-intensity factor solutions in terms of conservation integrals involving known auxiliary solutions. One of the salient features of the present analysis is that the stress-intensity solutions can be determined directly by using information extracted in the far field. Several examples with solutions available in the literature are solved to examine the accuracy and other characteristics of the current approach. This method is demonstrated to be superior in its numerical simplicity and computational efficiency to other approaches.

It is clearly shown that, when the curvature of the crack surface becomes sufﬁciently large, special care must be taken in the evaluation of both the volume and the area integrals involved. To improve the accuracy in the evaluation of the former, a composite rule for the Gaussian quadrature scheme is employed. Four benchmark geometries with available analytical solutions are considered. Firstly, mesh design parameters for planar cracks with straight and curved crack fronts are established. Secondly, non-planar cracks with straight and curved crack fronts are employed to examine the accuracy of the numerical procedure. Ó 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Since the previous paper was written (Banks-Sills, 1991, “Application of the Finite Element Method to Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics,” Appl. Mech. Rev., 44, pp. 447–461), much progress has been made in applying the finite element method to linear elastic fracture mechanics. In this paper, the problem of calculating stress intensity factors in two- and three-dimensional mixed mode problems will be considered for isotropic and anisotropic materials. The square-root singular stresses in the neighborhood of the crack tip will be modeled by quarter-point, square and collapsed, triangular elements for two-dimensional problems, respectively, and by brick and collapsed, prismatic elements in three dimensions. The stress intensity factors are obtained by means of the interaction energy or M-integral. Displacement extrapolation is employed as a check on the results. In addition, the problem of interface cracks between homogeneous, isotropic, and anisotropic materials is presented. The purpose of this paper is to present an accurate and efficient method for calculating stress intensity factors for mixed mode deformation. The equations presented here should aid workers in this field to carry out similar analyses, as well as to check their calculations with respect to the examples described.},

	abstract = {Use of the finite element method to treat two and three-dimensional linear elastic fracture mechanics problems is becoming common place. In general, the behavior of the displacement field in ordinary elements is at most quadratic or cubic, so that the stress field is at most linear or quadratic. On the other hand, the stresses in the neighborhood of a crack tip in a linear elastic material have been shown to be square root singular. Hence, the problem begins by properly modeling the stresses in the region adjacent to the crack tip with finite elements. To this end, quarter-point, singular, isoparametric elements may be employed; these will be discussed in detail. After that difficulty has been overcome, the stress intensity factor must be extracted from either the stress or displacement field or by an energy based method. Three methods are described here: displacement extrapolation, the stiffness derivative and the area and volume J-integrals. Special attention will be given to the virtual crack extension which is employed by the latter two methods. A methodology for calculating stress intensity factors in two and three-dimensional bodies will be recommended.},

It was found in the course of present investigation that the auxiliary solutions set by the asymptotic solutions of the crack did not satisfy the equilibrium in terms of the ﬁnite element model consisting of the quadratic tetrahedral element. Thus, the results of the interaction integral computations contained a large magnitude of numerical error. To overcome this problem, the authors propose to add correction terms to the asymptotic solutions and to form new auxiliary solutions. The correction terms are determined so that the auxiliary solutions satisfy the equilibrium of the ﬁnite element model by performing ﬁnite element computations. Some numerical demonstrations are presented and they show that proposed methodology can give more accurate stress intensity factor solutions than the case without the correction terms.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a mesh-independent ﬁnite element based method for propagating fractures in three dimensions. The iterative algorithm automatically grows fractures in a 3D brittle medium represented by an isotropic linear elastic matrix. Growth is controlled by an input failure and propagation criterion. The geometry and mesh are stored separately, and mesh reﬁnement is topologically guided. Propagation results in the modiﬁcation of crack geometry, as opposed to changes in the mesh, as the arbitrary tetrahedral mesh adapts to the evolving geometry. Stress intensity factors are computed using the volumetric J Integral on a virtual piecewise cylinder. Modal stress intensity factors are computed using the decomposition method. Mesh and cylinder size effects are studied, as is computational efﬁciency. A through-going crack embedded in a thick slab, and a horizontal and inclined penny-shape crack, are used to validate the accuracy of the method. The predicted stress intensity factors are in good agreement with analytical solutions. For six integration points per tip segment, integration local to single tips, and a cylinder radius that adapts to the local geometric conditions, results agree with analytical solutions with less than 5\% deviation from experimental results.},

	abstract = {A line integral is exhibited which has the same value for all paths surrounding the tip of a notch in the two-dimensional strain field of an elastic or deformation-type elastic-plastic material. Appropriate integration path choices serve both to relate the integral to the near tip deformations and, in many cases, to permit its direct evaluation. This averaged measure of the near tip field leads to approximate solutions for several strain-concentration problems. Contained perfectly plastic deformation near a crack tip is analyzed for the plane-strain case with the aid of the slip-line theory. Near tip stresses are shown to be significantly elevated by hydrostatic tension, and a strain singularity results varying inversely with distance from the tip in centered fan regions above and below the tip. Approximate estimates are given for the strain intensity, plastic zone size, and crack tip opening displacement, and the important role of large geometry changes in crack blunting is noted. Another application leads to a general solution for crack tip separations in the Barenblatt-Dugdale crack model. A proof follows on the equivalence of the Griffith energy balance and cohesive force theories of elastic brittle fracture, and hardening behavior is included in a model for plane-stress yielding. A final application leads to approximate estimates of strain concentrations at smooth-ended notch tips in elastic and elastic-plastic materials.},

In the most general case, dynamic fracture mechanics contains three complicating features that are not present in linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and elastic–plastic fracture mechanics: inertia forces, rate-dependent material behavior, and reflected stress waves. The dynamic version of LEFM is termed elastodynamic fracture mechanics, where the nonlinear material behavior is neglected, but inertia forces and reflected stress waves are incorporated when necessary. Dynamic fracture analyses that incorporate nonlinear, time-dependent material behavior are a relatively recent innovation. Dynamic propagation toughness can be measured as a function of crack speed by means of high-speed photography and optical methods, such as photoelasticity and the method of caustics. Time-dependent fracture mechanics approaches are required when creep failure is controlled by a dominant crack in the structure.},

	abstract = {Abstract : The use of composite sandwich construction is rapidly increasing in current and future airframe designs especially for general aviation aircraft and rotorcraft. Typically, sandwich constructions for these applications use thin-gage composite facesheets (0.020" to 0.045") which are cocured to honeycomb and foam cores. Due to the nature of these structures, damage tolerance is more complex than conventional laminated structures. Besides typical damage concerns such as through penetration and delamination, additional modes including core crushing and facesheet debonding must also be addressed. This complicates the certification process by introducing undefined Allowable Damage Limits (ADL) and Critical Damage Thresholds (CDT) as related to the ultimate and limit load carrying capability of the structure. This document provides a background review of previous damage tolerance investigations including an overview of traditional metallic damage tolerance methodologies. illustrative summaries are presented which show the scope of previous investigation parameters such as impact energy, facesheet thickness, and core thickness of typical sandwich constructions. Also included is a compilation of damage tolerance certification procedures and regulations taken from FAR Part 23-29 for composite damage tolerance as well as recommendations from associated Advisory Circulars. Past and current airframe industry sandwich constructions which show the scope of current and future sandwich designs were also surveyed. In conclusion, a proposed future research approach and its methodology are presented which should aid in establishing certification guidelines and confidence involving the damage tolerance of sandwich constructions as they apply to general aviation aircraft and rotorcraft.},

	abstract = {F3D/NG is a successor to the original FRANC3D program (now referred to as FRANC3D/Classic), which was developed at Cornell University in the late 1980's. While the two codes share a name, the next generation code benefits from over 20 years of experience developing and using the Classic code. The NG version is a complete rewrite employing different approaches for geometrical modeling and deformation analysis. The typical workflow for a F3D/NG analysis is shown in Figure 1. An analyst creates an uncracked FE mesh using the standard tools available for the commercial FE package. Typically, the analyst then defines a sub-model of the crack growth region. F3D/NG reads the sub-model mesh file and remeshes the sub-model to incorporate the geometry of a crack. The crack geometry and location can be prescribed either interactively using the Graphical User Interface (GUI) or programmatically using F3D/NG extensions to the Python programming language. The "cracked" sub-model is reintegrated into the remainder of the model and an analysis is performed. The resulting displacements are read back into F3D/NG, which then computes Stress Intensity Factors (SIF's) for all node points along the crack front. The SIF's are used to predict the direction and relative amount of growth of the crack front points. The crack is extended, the sub-model remeshed, and another stress analysis is performed. This process is repeated for the number of crack steps specified by the analyst. This paper is organized into five sections. The following section describes aspects of the crack growth modeling approach used within F3D/NG. The third section is a brief overview of F3D/NG's geometrical modeling and meshing pipeline. This is followed by an illustrative example and a brief summary.},

	abstract = {In the absence of automated and customized methods and tools, some of today’s existing methods for solving three-dimensional fracture problems require comprehensive finite element meshing, labor-intensive analysis and post-processing efforts. In this study, a tetrahedral enriched element method and related applications are presented that demonstrate employment of fully unstructured tetrahedral meshes for general mixed-mode three-dimensional fracture problems. As in the case of hexahedral enriched elements, the tetrahedral enriched elements also alleviate the needs of pre- and post-processing the finite element model, allowing direct computation of stress intensity factors in the solution phase. In addition, when tetrahedral enriched elements are used, the crack front region can also be meshed using unstructured elements allowing direct use of automatic free-meshing programs. The applications presented are plane-strain central crack problem, mode-I surface crack in a plate, inclined penny-shaped crack, edge-cracked bar under constant heat flux and lens-shaped crack embedded in a large elastic body. The results obtained are in good comparative agreement with those available in the literature. Thus, it is concluded that the enriched tetrahedral elements can be applied efficiently and accurately on a general three-dimensional fracture problem allowing usage of fully unstructured finite element meshes.},

To represent an arbitrary crack path, the element splitting scheme is developed on a polygonal mesh to capitalize its flexibility in element shape. For the accurate evaluation of a crack-tip stress field and crack propagation direction, the virtual grid-based stress recovery scheme is tailored for VEM in conjunction with the maximum strain energy release rate criterion. The mixed-mode fracture examples are illustrated to validate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed computational scheme. Numerical results demonstrate that the domain integral method with the stress recovery scheme captures an accurate crack path without oscillation under the biaxial tensile stress state. Furthermore, the computed cracks using the element splitting scheme show that smooth and curved patterns on polygonal elements are in good agreement with the experimental results.},

Because of the widespread adoption of 3D modeling of large and complex structures in the industry, the PSM has recently been boosted by including four-node and ten-node tetrahedral elements of Ansys FE software, which allows to discretize complex geometries. In this paper, a Round Robin among eleven Italian Universities has been performed to calibrate the PSM with seven different commercial FE software packages. Several 3D mode I, II and III problems have been considered to investigate the influence of (i) FE code, (ii) element type, (iii) mesh pattern, and (iv) procedure to extrapolate stresses at FE nodes. The majority of the adopted FE software packages present similar values of the PSM parameters, the main source of discrepancy being the stress extrapolation method at FE nodes.},

Nevertheless, for some materials undergoing large strain processes without noticeable volume changes, the discretization technique employed must not only describe the material behaviour but also correctly address the incompressibility constraints. In order to develop a robust formulation for this type of problems, an approach based on the analyses of the underlying sub-space of incompressible deformations embedded in the XFEM approximation is used, in the context of both infinitesimal and finite strains. This study motivated the extension of the conventional formulations of B-bar and F-bar to include the XFEM enrichment functions, whose performance is evaluated through some numerical examples and compared with competing methods such as the enhanced strain formulation.},

	abstract = {Structural systems are consistently encountering the variabilities in material properties, undesirable defects and loading environments, which may potentially shorten their designed service life. To ensure a reliable structural performance, it is vital to track and quantify the effects of different random/uncertainty factors upon the structural fracture performance. In this research, a critical review of the past, current and future computational modelling of the non-deterministic fracture mechanics is presented. By considering the variously numerical solutions tackling the fracture problems, they are mainly categorized into the discrete and continuous approaches. This study discusses the quantification performance of the extended finite element method, the crack band method and the phase-field approaches combined with different sources of uncertainties. These well-known computational techniques are typical representatives of the common fracture modelling philosophies including the embedded, smeared and regularized ones. The essence of this work is to compare the main differences of the uncertainty quantification models (i.e., probabilistic, non-probabilistic) at the fracture formulation levels and investigate the major progress and challenges existing in the real-life applications for the past and future decades. Some critical remarks, which are denoting the advantages and major issues of various non-deterministic fracture models, are provided and explained in the practical structural failure conditions. Different fracture simulation cases are implemented with comparative results amongst analytical, numerical and experimental methods, and the corresponding fracture quantification ability is evaluated through the standards of the random fracture capacity, load–deflection plots, crack propagation, crack mechanisms, and computational efficiency, etc.},

By improving the kernel function of SPH, the brittle fracture characteristics of rock materials are captured. In the improved SPH, a prefabricated node segment (PNS) method is used to generate arbitrarily complex open or closed cracks, avoiding the kernel truncation caused by digging out particles. In order to improve numerical stability, the tension instability control (TIC) technique is embedded in the momentum equation. Moreover, the improved SPH adopts the coupled dynamic buffer solid boundary treatment algorithm, which reduces the configuration of boundary virtual particles, makes the application of boundary conditions more efficient. The accuracy of the improved SPH method and the feasibility of TIC technique are verified by a benchmark example. Then, the effect of the center dislocation spacing of the pre-existing cross crack on the failure mode and compressive strength of rock samples is studied. In addition, the effects of confining pressure on the coalescence type and penetration failure mode of cracks in a rock sample with two pre-existing cracks are also investigated. The numerical results agree well with the experimental results, which verifies the accuracy and validity of the improved SPH method.},

TLSPH avoids the tensile instability encountered in conventional Eulerian kernel-based Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) by making use of the Lagrangian kernel. In the present approach, the support domain of a particle is modified, where it only interacts with its immediately neighbouring particles. The gradient correction is employed to avoid the inconsistency of SPH approximation induced by insufficient neighbouring particles. A virtual link is used to define the level of interaction between each particle pair. The state of the virtual link is determined by damage law or cracking criterion. The virtual link approach allows easy and natural modelling of cracking surfaces without explicit cracking treatments such as particle splitting, field enrichment or visibility criterion. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via a few numerical examples of both brittle and ductile failure under impact loading.},

Since the conventional intrinsic enrichment criteria is capable of modeling straight cracks only, hence some modifications have been proposed so as to extend its capability for modeling kinked crack. The effectiveness of proposed criterion is demonstrated by modeling cracks with multiple kinked segments. Further, the proposed criterion has been successfully implemented for simulating quasi-static crack growth under mix mode loading conditions.},

	abstract = {Finding the optimum quarter point element (QPE) in numerical fracture mechanics is complicated by the variability of the singularity-dominated zone existing in the vicinity of a cracktip from one crack configuration to another. This forces the universal optimum to be defined in a weak sense. Apart from their characteristics as “sentinel”-elements, proper sizing for singular transition elements is proposed. Numerical assessments indicate that certain geometrical shape regularity is required for the QPE, and that with the use of transition elements, the universal optimum QPE size lies in the range of 15–25\% of the crack length for a 5\% error bound. Supported by numerical experiments conducted and the use of proper transition elements' sizes proposed, this result can reasonably be conjectured to general crack configurations. In fact in a crack propagation model without adaptivity technique, the universal optimum strategy should give the “best” results possible. In a crack propagation model where topological changes discretely occur, the universal optimum in the strong sense may only be attainable when both remeshing and adaptivity techniques are blended. For an accurate determination of stress intensity factors (SIFs), it is recommended to conduct a few convergence studies about the universal optimum size to obtain the lower bound error. For a crack propagation model that uses stresses and/or energy-based failure criteria, it is suggested that the second term of the Williams' series expansion be included to improve accuracy.},

	abstract = {In the course of an investigation of the effect of surface scratches on the mechanical strength of solids, some general conclusions were reached which appear to have a direct bearing on the problem of rupture, from an engineering standpoint, and also on the larger question of the nature of intermolecular cohesion. The original object of the work, which was carried out at the Royal Aircraft Estab­lishment, was the discovery of the effect of surface treatment—such as, for instance, filing, grinding or polishing—on the strength of metallic machine parts subjected to alternating or repeated loads. In the case of steel, and some other metals in common use, the results of fatigue tests indicated that the range of alternating stress which could be permanently sustained by the material was smaller than the range within which it was sensibly elastic, after being subjected to a great number of reversals. Hence it was inferred that the safe range of loading of a part, having a scratched or grooved surface of a given type, should be capable of estimation with the help of one of the two hypotheses of rupture commonly used for solids which are elastic to fracture. According to these hypotheses rupture may be expected if (a) the maximum tensile stress, (
              b
              ) the maximum extension, exceeds a certain critical value. Moreover, as the behaviour of the materials under consideration, within the safe range of alternating stress, shows very little departure from Hooke’s law, it was thought that the necessary stress and strain calculations could be performed by means of the mathematical theory of elasticity.},

It is pointed out that for somewhat brittle tensile fractures in situations such that a generalized plane-stress or a plane-strain analysis is appropriate, the influence of the test configuration, loads, and crack length upon the stresses near an end of the crack may be expressed in terms of two parameters. One of these is an adjustable uniform stress parallel to the direction of a crack extension. It is shown that the other parameter, called the stress-intensity factor, is proportional to the square root of the force tending to cause crack extension. Both factors have a clear interpretation and field of usefulness in investigations of brittle-fracture mechanics.},

The general three-dimensional finite domain integral expression and the two-dimensional and axisymmetric specializations for the energy release rate are given. The domain expression is naturally compatible with the finite element formulation of the field equations. As such it is ideally suited for efficient and accurate calculation of the pointwise values of the energy release rate along a three-dimensional crack front. The finite element implementation of the domain integral corresponds to the virtual crack extension technique.

Furthermore, we analyzed the execution time and memory used by multiple algorithms in both the languages with best, average, and worst cases. They are also compared with respect to the benefits and issues related to them. Results indicate that C++ is faster than Python in execution speed but Python serves as a better language for beginners due to its simplicity.
